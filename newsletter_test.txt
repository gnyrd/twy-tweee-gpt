TWEEE Prompt for Newsletter

Ok a big request! 
I want a blog post based on how Anusara and non dual tantra look at the cycles of life (and death) The OM - you’re parts. How we are at that point in the cycle where honoring the dissolution- release- death cycle can be our sacred offering. See the brief description in the attached. Write the blog as an invitation to honor our life by embracing all that was created, given, and shared by anyone who made an impact on our lives- and have passed on. May we all rise to more conscious and empowering LIVING because of what we’ve been gifted. 

There needs to be a thread in the blog that reminds us we’re at the end of the month and about to begin anew. Interesting that November begins by honoring the death and life of those who’ve come before us! 

Then take all the class plans for the week and come up with one affirmation for the week. 

Work that into the blog. 

Intermediate Prompt #1

Well, it’s good and way too long. 
I somehow want it to be more pithy and impactful. 

Intermediate Prompt #2

Almost perfect! 
Keep it and add on a reason to bring reverence to what holds them in how we all come from the same light and to it we will return. How can we bring in Kali and how she holds The One Light in perspective to remember that being here, now, is a sacred gift.

The Sacred Pause: Honoring the Cycle

In Tantra and Anusara, everything — birth, growth, decay, renewal — pulses with the same divine rhythm.
The sound of OM holds it all:
A — creation.
U — sustenance.
M — dissolution.
And then, the silence — the sacred pause where everything rests before beginning again.

We are in that pause now.
The end of October invites us to honor what has passed — the lives, loves, and lessons that shaped us.
This is the holy work of remembrance: not clinging to what was, but bowing in gratitude for all that gave us life.

To honor death is to celebrate life.
To let go with reverence is to remember that we come from the same light, and to it we will return.

Kali — fierce mother of transformation — reminds us that endings are not destruction, but liberation.
She clears away illusion so we can see the eternal flame that never dies — the One Light that lives through all forms.
To live awake to this truth is to meet each breath, each body, each moment as sacred.

So let this week be an offering.
Move with reverence for what holds you — the earth beneath, the ancestors behind, the light within and around you.
This, right here, is holy ground.

Weekly Affirmation:
“I honor what has passed and rise with gratitude, remembering that the same light that created me will one day receive me.”
