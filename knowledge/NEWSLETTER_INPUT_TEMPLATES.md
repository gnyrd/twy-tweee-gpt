## TIPS FOR FASTEST INPUT

1. **Don't overthink it** - First thought, best thought
2. **Incomplete is fine** - AI can fill gaps if you provide the core
3. **Use shorthand** - "Kali energy + shadow work + current grief" is enough
4. **Trust the templates** - The structure does most of the work
5. **Skip what doesn't fit** - Not every newsletter needs every element
