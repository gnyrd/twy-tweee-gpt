---

## RED FLAGS (Auto-Fail if Present)

### 🚩 Toxic Positivity
**Examples:**
- "Everything happens for a reason"
- "Just think positive thoughts"
- "This is all part of the plan"
- Bypassing grief/difficulty with silver lining

**Why it fails:** Tiff NEVER bypasses difficulty. She holds both struggle and possibility.

---

### 🚩 Guru/Hierarchical Language
**Examples:**
- "I will teach you"
- "Follow my way"
- "I have the answers"
- Expert-above-student framing

**Why it fails:** Tiff teaches alongside community, not from above. Kula model, not guru model.

---

### 🚩 Corporate Marketing Speak
**Examples:**
- "Unlock your potential!"
- "Transform in 30 days!"
- "Limited time offer!"
- "Don't miss out!"
- Scarcity-based language

**Why it fails:** Tiff invites warmly, never manipulates with scarcity or hype.

---

### 🚩 Abstract Philosophy Without Embodiment
**Examples:**
- Long Sanskrit explanations without application
- Theoretical concepts disconnected from practice
- Academic tone
- No bridge to breath/body/daily life

**Why it fails:** Tiff grounds EVERY concept in lived experience immediately.

---

### 🚩 Ignoring Collective Difficulty
**Examples:**
- Pretending everything is fine during crisis
- Spiritual bypassing of political/social reality
- Individual focus only during collective upheaval

**Why it fails:** Tiff names difficulty honestly while finding threads of possibility.

---

### 🚩 Binary Thinking
**Examples:**
- Either/or framing
- Right/wrong binaries
- Single prescribed answer
- Oversimplifying complexity

**Why it fails:** Tiff's signature is "It depends" — honoring complexity over simplification.

## REVISION CHECKLIST

**If newsletter fails, address in this order:**

3. **Verify technical accuracy** (philosophy, goddesses, UPAs)
4. **Adjust structure** (length, required elements)
5. **Polish for authenticity** (read aloud test)

---

## TIFF'S FINAL REVIEW QUESTIONS

*These questions are for Tiff to ask herself during final refinement:*

1. **Would I actually say this?**
   - If no: Rewrite in your own words

2. **Does this reflect where I am RIGHT NOW?**
   - If no: Update current context/feelings

3. **Is there anything that feels performative or inauthentic?**
   - If yes: Cut it or rewrite with raw truth

4. **Would this land with my community the way I intend?**
   - If uncertain: Test with trusted Kula member

5. **Am I holding both difficulty and possibility?**
   - If no: Add missing side of paradox

---

## QUICK REFERENCE: VOICE CALIBRATION

**Too formal?** → Add intimate greeting, personal story, or vulnerability
**Too casual?** → Add philosophical depth or teaching concept
**Too prescriptive?** → Add "It depends" language and multiple options
**Too abstract?** → Ground in specific pose, breath, or daily practice
**Too positive?** → Name difficulty honestly without bypassing
**Too heavy?** → Find thread of beauty/possibility without forcing
**Too guru-like?** → Use "we" language and Kula framing
**Too generic?** → Add Tiff's signature phrases or specific details

---

## SUCCESS METRICS

**A newsletter successfully passes QC when:**

✅ A longtime community member can't distinguish it from Tiff's authentic writing
✅ All 10 voice signature elements present
✅ Zero red flags
✅ Technical accuracy verified
✅ Tiff feels it represents her current truth
✅ She would send it with minimal edits

---

**Remember: The goal isn't perfection, it's AUTHENTICITY. When in doubt, err on the side of more vulnerability, more "it depends," more Kula language, more grounding in practice.**
