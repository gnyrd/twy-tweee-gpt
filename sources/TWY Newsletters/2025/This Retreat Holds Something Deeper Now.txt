Dear JP,

Some things… shift everything.
When I lost my mom last week, it was one of those moments. A tender threshold.
A raw, real reminder of why we gather. Why we pause. Why we create space for
grief, for joy, for remembering what’s truly sacred.
This retreat has always been about aligning with the light within. But now—more
than ever—it’s about something deeper:
Holding space for what life brings
Releasing what no longer serves
Gathering in the fullness of what remains
From June 20–22, we’ll gather in the rolling hills of Palouse for
Ignite the Light Within: A Summer Solstice Retreat
A weekend of movement, ritual, reKection, and community.
Not a getaway. A coming home.
Together we’ll share:
Grounding yoga and breath practices
Sacred Mre ceremony at Kamiak Butte
Journaling, sound baths, and soul-deep connection
Time to feel again—and be held in it

This space is being prepared with such care.
And if your soul has been whispering that it’s time—listen.
Registration Is Still Open
We have just a few spots left (5–10) and registration is still open.
If you’re feeling the call—this is your invitation.

If you've been in the weeds... in transition... or feeling like your inner light has
been Kickering—this retreat is your Mre. Your recalibration. Your chance to
reconnect with what truly matters.
Come be part of something sacred.
Come stand in the light—with all of it.
With tenderness,
Tiff
