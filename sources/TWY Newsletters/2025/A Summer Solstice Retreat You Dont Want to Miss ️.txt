Hello JP,
Imagine this: three days dedicated entirely to you. Time to move, breathe, and
reconnect. A space to slow down, soak in the summer sun, and realign with your inner
light.
This June, join me for Ignite the Light Within: A Summer Solstice Yoga Retreat—a
transformative gathering designed to help you restore balance, awaken your energy, and
celebrate this powerful seasonal shift.
Set in the heart of Palouse, we’ll weave together:
Grounding yoga practices to strengthen and soften
Time in nature to reflect and recharge
A sacred fire ceremony to honor the sun—and your own journey
Community circles filled with shared wisdom and deep connection
This isn’t just a retreat; it’s an opportunity to step away from the noise, reconnect with
yourself, and return home feeling radiant and renewed.
If you’ve been craving more space, more connection, and more you time—this is your
invitation.
Spots are limited, and I would love for you to be there. Reserve your place now!

See you soon,
Tiffany
