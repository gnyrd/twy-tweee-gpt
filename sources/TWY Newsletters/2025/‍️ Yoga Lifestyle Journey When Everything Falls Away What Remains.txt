Yoga Lifestyle Journey
Subject: Navigating Change Together – A Sacred Conversation
Dear Kula,

We are living through an extraordinary time in our collective journey. So
much of what I once knew as support and stability is being stripped
away. My identity shifts daily as I step into deeply challenging realities—
both of my parents in radical decline, long-held beliefs unraveling, and
stories I’ve clung to being exposed. Growth is no longer optional; it is
required. Our country, too, is changing rapidly, and in this uncertainty, we
must turn to what we hold sacred and show up for it.
Thirty-three years ago, The Fifth Sacred Thing transformed my
worldview. Now, more than ever, I see it as a powerful tool to deepen our
collective identity, spark meaningful conversations, and expand our
capacity to meet change with resilience.
Watch this short video where I share why this book is so relevant for our
times and Kula. I hope it inspires you to read it and join us on April 8 for
our community support event.
With heart,
Tiff

The Fifth Sacred Thing
by Starhawk
Why Read The Fifth Sacred Thing Now?
As rapid changes disrupt our local & global structures, we have a choice:
respond in love, not fear. In power, not complacency. This novel calls us
to remember what truly matters and to stand
together in the face of uncertainty.
Key Themes & Why They Matter Now:
1. Reclaiming Our Values & Defending Them – In times of chaos, we
must be clear on what we stand for and be willing to protect it.
2. Hope for the Future – Even in the face of destruction, resilience and
unity can lead us forward.
3. Living in Alignment with Spirit – To live in harmony with truth, nature,
and community is both our birthright and our responsibility.
4. Embracing Our Sacred Role in Community – Now more than ever, we
must listen to our gifts, trust our collective wisdom, and take action
together.
This is an opportunity to connect in community in a way that will give us
a place to LAND IN THE EMPOWERMENT OF HEART WISDOM.
It’s a call to remember, to rise, and to shape the world with love.
JOIN us April 8th
for a heart-centered community discussion
