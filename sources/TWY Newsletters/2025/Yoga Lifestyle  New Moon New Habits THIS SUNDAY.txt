We’ve entered the eclipse portal — and this one is a South Node Eclipse
in Virgo. That means closure, release, and a chance to reset the patterns
that keep us stuck. The shadow of Virgo shows up as self-criticism,
perfectionism, and projecting what we can’t face inside onto the world
outside. The deeper work? Owning those projections and choosing
integrity instead of self-betrayal.
By showing up to your yoga, you’re already doing this work. Every

By showing up to your yoga, you’re already doing this work. Every
practice is a step toward releasing what no longer serves and aligning
with what truly nourishes. Eclipse energy lingers for months — so now is
the time to recalibrate your daily rhythm with intention.
This Sunday’s New Moon, New Habit Meditation + Dharma Talk will
guide you through just that:

Owning your projections so they no longer own you
Resetting your routines — as acts of love and integrity
Aligning your practice with the energy of this eclipse for long-term
transformation
Don’t miss this opportunity to work with the eclipse energy directly and
set a foundation that carries you forward.
With steadiness and love,
Tiff

NEW MOON, NEW HABIT
Sunday, September 21 at 3:30 PM MT
The best thing you can do is meditate and recalibrate. Not to escape, but to reset.
This Sunday at 3:30 PM MT, we gather for New Moon ~ New Habit!
Yoga is not simply a physical practice. It’s about syncing with your deeper rhythm
so your energy, mood, and clarity aren’t left up to chance.
The New Moon invites contraction before expansion. Essential alchemy is
the reminder to distill — to come back to what is truly enough for your own
wellbeing and contribution. Instead of being scattered in a thousand
reactive directions, we become precise, steady, and clear.
Why it matters for yogis: When householders live with the practice of
“enough,” they stay resourced. That means we can engage civically (vote,
show up, have hard conversations, support our communities) without
burning out or spiraling into despair.
So in short:
This September New Moon helps us by pulling our energy into clarity to
release KARMIC patterning. The change you want out there, starts inside!
