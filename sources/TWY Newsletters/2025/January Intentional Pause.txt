Let’s align, expand, and thrive—together.

January: Intentional Pause
We begin the year by slowing down. With Mars retrograde in Cancer,
motivation may feel sluggish, and energy reserves are low. January’s
theme, Intentional Pause, invites you to rest, reSect, and rejuvenate—
without guilt or hesitation.
A7rmation of the Month:
“Without guilt, shame, or reluctance, I partake in the productive act of
rest. I am not so important that I cannot pause. I am far too valuable to
run myself ragged.”
Mood of the Month:
Slow down, breathe, and resist the urge to rush into 2025. Through
grounding asana, introspective journaling, and restorative poses, we’ll
align with January’s call for deliberate action and emotional clarity.
Weekly Support:
Each week brings a new aXrmation and journal prompt to deepen your
practice.
• Week 1 AXrmation: “I embrace stillness as a necessary preparation for
action.”
• Week 1 Journal Prompt: “What unmet needs are surfacing, and how
can I nurture myself to meet them?”
