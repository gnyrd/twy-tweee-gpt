Melt Into Radiance: A Love Note for the Eclipse Portal
Today’s message is a bit of a cosmic love letter.
One part says “feel everything”, the other says “become
something.” Together, they’re asking: Can you soften… and rise?

something.” Together, they’re asking: Can you soften… and rise?
This is not your average Thursday (or whatever day it is when you’re reading
this).

This is an energetic threshold—a moment to pause, root, and maybe, just
maybe, blossom a little.
In today’s Rise & Renew yoga Dynamic Flow practice, we began by
turning inward with a verse from the Vijnana Bhairava Tantra. It
whispered:
“Melt into the radiance of your heart.
Become the sky—embrace the inInite.
Let the wave of love carry you back to your essence.”
Honestly? That’s the whole practice right there.
So what does it mean to melt into radiance?
It means dropping the armor. Letting your breath move like honey.
Sitting with your own heart long enough to remember that clarity doesn’t
come from forcing—it comes from listening. From softening. From
loving what’s already inside.
Today gives us the gift of receptivity. The Solar Eclipse, this Saturday,
gives us the chance to renew. This moment is both cosmic and wildly
personal.
Want to work with the energy today? Here’s a simple eclipse-portal
practice:

Seriously. Just rest. Let your body exhale. This is the start of returning to

Seriously. Just rest. Let your body exhale. This is the start of returning to
yourself.
2. Try this mantra from your own breath:
Inhale: “I melt.”
Exhale: “I rise.”
3. Visualize your heart as a sky.
Expansive. Quiet. Capable of holding both storm and sunlight.
4. Whisper to yourself (bonus points if it’s out loud):
“I don’t have to push to grow. I just have to be ready to bloom.”
5. Stay soft. Stay awake.
This portal isn’t about manifesting something Pashy—it’s about aligning
with the current of your own truth.

So today, don’t rush the rising.
Let the wave of love carry you.
You might just Rnd your next beginning is already unfolding—quietly,
beautifully, from the inside out.
Happy Eclipse, love.
