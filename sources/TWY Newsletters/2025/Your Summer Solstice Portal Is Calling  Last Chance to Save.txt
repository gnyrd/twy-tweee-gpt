Step Into the Fire — Final Weekend for Early
Bird Retreat Savings
Dear JP,
If you’ve been waiting for a sign—this is it.
This Solstice is unlike any other.
It’s not just a date on the calendar—it’s a portal.
A powerful threshold. A cosmic YES.
And I’ve never been more excited to hold space for it.
From June 20–22, we’ll gather in the rolling hills of Palouse for Ignite the Light
Within: A Summer Solstice Retreat—a three-day journey of movement, rest,
reconnection, and Hre.
This isn’t just a getaway—it’s a reawakening.
A sacred space for people who are ready to shift. To shed. To expand.
To show up for themselves—and for the world—with more purpose, softness, and
soul.
