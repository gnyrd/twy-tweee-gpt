Hi Love,
I know it’s summer, and for many of us, that means movement—travel,
family, full calendars, and days that =y by before we even touch the mat.
But beneath the busyness, something much bigger is happening.
On July 7, Uranus entered Gemini for the Frst time since 1941. That last

On July 7, Uranus entered Gemini for the Frst time since 1941. That last
cycle aligned with global war, technological upheaval, and a complete
reordering of the world. This time, the outer patterns are different—but
the energetic magnitude is just as real.
Systems are shifting.
Truths are surfacing.
And the frequency is rising.
You might feel this as restlessness, overwhelm, sensitivity, or
disconnection. You might also feel numb, checked out, or like you’re just
trying to keep up.
All of that is valid.
What I want to remind you—gently, but Frmly—is this:
Your practice is not optional in times like these.

It’s the very thing that helps your body process intensity, your mind
return to clarity, and your spirit remember what it’s connected to.
This is where the Tantric principle of Spanda becomes more than a
concept.
It becomes a lifeline.
Spanda is the sacred pulse—the natural rhythm of contraction and
expansion that lives in your breath, your heartbeat, and the cycles of
change all around us.
Right now, Spanda is not asking you to do more.
It’s asking you to tune in. To move with rhythm instead of reaction.
So this week, I’m inviting you back:

Not to force anything.
Not to “Fx” yourself.
But to return to your mat, your breath, your body—so you can meet
the world from center.
Even 15 minutes counts. Even one breath matters.
Because the world is pulsing—and your nervous system deserves a
rhythm it can trust.
I’m with you in it.
See you on the mat (or in the breath).
With steadiness,
Tiff
