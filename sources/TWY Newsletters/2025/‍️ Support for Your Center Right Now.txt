Dear Yogis,
Last Week’s Gathering:
Our New Moon, New Habit circle was powerful—many of you felt deeply
supported and inspired to greater Self-Care in the days that followed.
That truly makes my heart sing!
In today’s chaotic world, staying centered and clear isn’t optional for the
householder yogi. It’s essential. You can Bnd the recording of our

householder yogi. It’s essential. You can Bnd the recording of our

On-Demand Support:
Your library now has 5 guided meditations—perfect for mornings,
evenings, or whenever you can carve out a pocket of sacred time. (See
below)
Next Live Circle:
We’ll meet again on the New Moon, Sunday, September 21, 2025.
Support in practicing enough—an alchemy that steadies us amid
cultural chaos by knowing HOW to choose what is truly essential and
sustainable.
Why It Matters:
Our circle is your safe space: to stay motivated, to connect with yogis
who support what matters to YOU, and to nourish your wellbeing.
With steadiness + compassion,
Tiffany
