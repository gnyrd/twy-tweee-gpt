Dear JP,
Thank you again to everyone who joined our LIVE class—what a beautiful way to
stay connected and rooted in community.
If you missed it, no worries:
The replay is now available—and so is Class 2
You can return to the beginning or dive right into this next offering.
Watch now - includes Class 1 replay + Class 2
Class 2: Ground + Remember
A slow, deeply supportive class to reconnect and reset.
We focus on:
Passive Muscular Energy — Let gravity + breath release tension in your
shoulders, jaw, and arms.
Head Loop + Skull Loop — Gentle alignment to unwind your neck, open your
chest, and clear space at the base of your skull.
If your nervous system has been holding too much… this is for you.
Watch now - includes Class 1 replay + Class 2
Feeling the Shift? Stay in the Flow.
If you've felt even a glimmer of ease, presence, or surprise—know this:

It’s not a Kuke.
This is what happens when you show up with care. When you choose to keep
going.
The more you practice, the more it builds.
The more supported you feel.
And the easier it becomes to come back home to yourself.
What’s Next?
Class 3: LIVE + Integration Circle
Monday, July 7 @ 5:30pm MT
We’ll move together—and then gather for a short reKection to close the series.

I hope you’ll keep walking with me. You deserve that kind of support.
With so much love,
Tiff
P.S. If your heart is whispering “I want more of this…”
You’re not alone. That’s why I created the Yoga Lifestyle Membership—so we can
stay connected, keep practicing, and keep growing.
More on that soon
