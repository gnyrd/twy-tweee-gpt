Yoga Lifestyle Journey
My beloved YLS Kula,
I wanted to share something personal with you—because if anyone
understands the power of staying anchored in self-care while the storm
swirls… it’s us.

swirls… it’s us.
After seven intense weeks, my dad is Gnally being discharged from the
nursing facility. It’s hard to put into words what this stretch has required
of me. It’s been the most demanding chapter of adulting I’ve ever walked
through—physically, emotionally, logistically. Just navigating Medicare
felt like a full-time job and miracle rolled into one.
And honestly? It’s been a soul-stretch.
Caring for someone who wasn’t always able to care for me has pushed
me to edges I didn’t know I had. I don’t come from a close or easy bond
with my father. But he’s my dad—the only one I’ve ever known. And in
these past weeks, I’ve come face to face with what it really means to
love someone unconditionally and protect my own energy.
I’ve learned to advocate Gercely while staying soft.
To set boundaries that protect my health.
To keep showing up… even when it’s messy.
The Ayurvedic habits—our habits—have been my saving grace. I haven’t
been perfect. My clothes don’t Gt quite the same. My routine’s taken hits.
But the scaffolding held.
And yes, I did fall into survival mode—often. But I could see it. I knew
what was happening. And because of these practices, I had just enough
tools to pull myself back above water, again and again. That thread of
Self Care, however frayed, still held.
And you—you incredible community—you gave me reasons to stay in
practice.
To stay in rhythm.
To remember the “why.”

I love you. I thank you. I couldn’t do this without the sacred container
we’ve created together.
We truly do hold each other up.
With deep love and Gerce gratitude,
Tiff
