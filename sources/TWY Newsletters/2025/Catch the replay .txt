Cleanse Prep Call Replay
Dear JP,

Thank you to everyone who joined us live for last night’s Kula Cleanse
Prep + Info Call — it was such a sweet space to gather, ask questions,
and feel the beauty of what’s ahead.
If you missed it or want to revisit it, here’s the replay:

Still feeling unsure if this is for you?
Start simple. Start here:
Focus on your morning and evening rhythms
Wake up on time — this will anchor the whole cleanse
Wind down gently at night — let your body start to exhale
That’s it.

That’s it.
Let everything else build from there.
This cleanse is about creating space, not adding pressure.
There’s still time to join us!
The cleanse starts May 12, and we’d love to welcome you in.
You won’t be doing this alone — we’ll be walking with you every step of
the way. Gentle guidance, daily support, and a kula to hold you.
Want to do this with a friend?
Bring a buddy and save $47 each with code BUDDYCLEANSE — they
don’t need to be a member to join you.
Regular member price: $197
Buddy price: $150 each with the code
Let this be something you move through together — supported, seen,
and connected.

Join Us

With love + deep breaths,
Tiff
