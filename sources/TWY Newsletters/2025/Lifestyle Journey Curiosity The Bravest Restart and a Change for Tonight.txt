Yoga Lifestyle Journey
Dear ones,
Three weeks ago, my Momma—my matriarch, my grounding rod—left
this world. Since then, everything has shifted.
I’ve felt untethered, walking ground that no longer holds its familiar

I’ve felt untethered, walking ground that no longer holds its familiar
shape. And yet, under this Gemini New Moon, something quiet is stirring
—a soft invitation to begin again.
From a Tantric view, endings are the sacred tremors of Grace unfolding.
What if the rug being pulled isn’t life falling apart—but life rearranging for
what’s next?
The sound of OM ends in silence—the stillness after becoming. That’s
where I am now. And maybe, in your own way, you are too.
So I’ll leave you with this:
Where is your restart?
What opens when you loosen your grip on how it’s always been?
Let’s stay curious.
Let’s listen more deeply.
Let’s trust Grace—even here.
With love in the mystery,
Tiffany
