You don’t need to fast or stop
your life to feel better
Dear JP,
I hear you:
“I want to reset, but I can’t take a bunch of time off.”
“I’m not into restrictive cleanses — I need something realistic.”
Same. That’s exactly why we created the Kula Cleanse.
This isn’t about restriction, punishment, or perfection. It’s a 10-day guided
Ayurvedic reset that helps you feel clearer, lighter, and more energized — without
fasting, supplements, or stepping away from your life.
You’ll be supported with:
Daily structure (food, movement, practices)

Grounding tools to anchor your nervous system
Live calls, community, and room to do this your way
Whether you’re working, parenting, traveling, or simply moving through life — this
is designed to meet you where you are.

Save the Date:
We’re holding a live prep + info call on May 1 @ 6:30pm MT — come get all your
questions answered!
Not sure if it’s right for you?
Reach out to Adele via email at simplylivingayurveda@gmail.com — She will talk
it through with you. No pressure, no push. Just here to support you.

With love & warm tea,
Tiff
