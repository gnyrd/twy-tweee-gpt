Welcome to Embracing the Light—
your next step in the journey.
Dear JP,
Thank you.
For showing up, softening, expanding, laughing, releasing, and radiating your light
with us this weekend.
The Ignite the Light Within retreat was truly magical—and it was your presence
that made it sacred.
I hope you're still feeling the warmth of the Are, the sweetness of community, and
the Solstice light moving through you. And I hope you’re giving yourself space to
rest and integrate all that opened.

Embracing the Light Begins
This retreat wasn’t the end—it was the spark. Over the next few weeks, I’ll be
sharing a 3-class integration experience called Embracing the Light—a curated
series to help you stay connected to your practice, your heart, and your light.
You’ll receive your Arst-class next week. No extra sign-up needed.

In the Meantime… Re1ect.
A few prompts to revisit your Soul Map—or simply journal with:
What felt most surprising or healing during the retreat?
What did you release into the Are?
What light are you carrying forward now?

Share Your Favorite Moments
Drop 3–5 retreat photos (or just a favorite memory!) in the WhatsApp group so
we can relive the magic together.
We’ll be creating a few highlight reels to honor our shared experience.
And if you’re holding something that needs space—a question, a shift, a tender
place—just reply to this email. I’m here for you.
With a full heart,
Tiffany
