Yoga Lifestyle Journey

Yoga Lifestyle Journey
Hey love,
Let’s be real: May’s not easing us in. The world’s a bit louder, the days are a bit
fuller, and the “energy” (yes, that energy) feels like it’s trying to light a Dre
under every unprocessed emotion you’ve been storing in your hips since
2018.
But here’s the gift in all that heat: it shows us where we actually want to grow
—not by pushing harder, but by staying steady in the middle of it all. This
month inside the Yoga Lifestyle, we’re exploring the theme Grace Filled—
because true soul growth doesn’t mean escaping the chaos. It means rooting
deeper, listening better, and moving forward with Derce softness.
Expect practices that help you build strength without armoring up, open your
heart without leaking your energy, and grow in ways that are aligned—not
performative. Whether you’re thriving, surviving, or just trying not to throw
your phone into the ocean, this space is here to hold you.
Let’s meet the Dre—together—with breath, humor, and a mat.
With you in the heat,
Tiff
