Yoga Lifestyle Journey
Hi sweet one,
Before anything else—thank you.
Your messages, your prayers, your quiet check-ins after my mom’s
passing—have meant more to me than I can say. In a time when

everything felt suspended and strange, your love has been one of the
most grounding forces in my life.
And now… something is shifting. Maybe you’ve felt it too. The swirl is
still here, sure—but there’s a warmth returning. A softness. The kind that
doesn’t ignore grief or uncertainty but makes space for joy anyway.
This week begins a new energetic chapter. Not one where we fake it, but
where we start to remember: we’re allowed to feel good. We’re allowed
to root down and open back up.
It’s not about pretending it’s all Lne. It’s about living like something
beautiful might still be possible.
With so much love,
Tiff
