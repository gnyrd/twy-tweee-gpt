Dear Yoga Lifestyle Member,
This Friday’s New Moon is not subtle. We’re standing inside a
shockwave of endings and beginnings—systems unraveling,
technologies accelerating, daily life reshaped in ways we can’t ignore.
Here’s the truth: Our practice is how we learn to hold presence in chaos

Here’s the truth: Our practice is how we learn to hold presence in chaos
—and that presence is power.
This is not politics as usual, not frantic activism, but yogis choosing to
show up awake, compassionate, and grounded in truth. Engagement
becomes an extension of practice—where breath, values, and action
meet.

NEW MOON, NEW HABIT
Friday, August 22 at 12 pm MT
we’ll gather live to explore:
How to stand rooted in personal presence during times of collective
upheaval.
What yogic civic engagement looks like now—when systems feel
shaky.
How to align practice, purpose, and participation in the world around
us.
This isn’t fear. It’s liberation. The world is reorganizing, and so can we.
Join us in conversation, practice, and visioning—together.

Yes, it’s short notice… I’m working with inspiration. Yes, it will be
recorded.
With devotion and love,
Tiff

Violet Flame Meditation

Violet Flame Meditation

When life asks us to revisit the tender parts of ourselves we’ve hidden or
outgrown —we can use this meditation to invite radical clarity and inner
recalibration.
This guided meditation calls in the Violet Flame of Transmutation and the
presence of Archangel Zadkiel, who holds the frequencies of forgiveness, mercy,
and alchemical transformation.
You’ll be guided to:
• Visualize violet light in the heart space
• Offer old wounds, confusion, or resentment to the Tame
• Reconnect to a voice of inner truth and grace
• Remember that healing doesn’t mean erasing the wound—it means loving
yourself through it
Ideal for moments of emotional heaviness, energetic clearing, or spiritual
integration.
Sit comfortably, close your eyes, and let this practice sanctify your inner space.
“You are not broken. You are breaking open.”
