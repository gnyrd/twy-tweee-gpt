Loves,
We’re standing at the threshold of October—half in, half out. And that’s
okay.
This moment holds a kind of pause, doesn’t it? A chance to catch your
breath, to look around, to remember who you are before you move
forward.
Personally, I’ve been moving through a bit of fog—emotional, spiritual,
energetic—and I’m just starting to feel the light breaking through. The
transformation is still happening, but something inside feels clearer.
October begins not with a bang, but with a sigh of relief. A long exhale.

Theme of the Week: A Long Exhale
Affirmation: I honor my rhythm. I breathe. I reset.

This moment between months is quiet, but potent.
We’re still in a waning moon phase, gently letting go of what September
stirred up. It’s the perfect time to pause, re9ect, and integrate—not
rushing to the next thing, but gathering yourself before October opens.
Let your practice this week be about slowness with intention. Let it feel
like a return—not a reinvention.

Member Practices this Week
Inside the library, you’ll Jnd classes that meet this moment—whether
you’re craving grounding, movement, stillness, or radiance. If you’re not
sure where to begin, just ask yourself:
“What do I need right now?”
Then start there. Trust the answer.
Whether it’s a full Low, a short meditation, or simply lying in savasana—
your practice belongs to you.

We win by refusing to forget who we are.”
