Hello Loves,
We often think of joy as something we earn—after hard work, deep
healing, or a perfectly aligned pose. But in the Tantric view, joy
(ānanda) is actually a fundamental quality of consciousness—a built-in
wisdom that shows us we’re in right relationship with ourselves and the
world.

When we feel genuine joy—not performative happiness, but grounded,
soul-level joy—it’s often because we’re:
In alignment with our purpose
Acting from inner truth rather than external pressure
Moving from presence, not performance
In that way, joy becomes the guide, not the reward.
It teaches us what’s real. It reveals what matters. It brings us back when
we’ve strayed.
So instead of striving for joy, we can ask:
“Where is joy already trying to lead me?”

In your practice, joy might show up as a breath that feels full, a pose that
feels powerful, or a moment of stillness that feels like home. That’s joy
doing what all great teachers do—pointing you back to yourself.
See you on the mat,
Tiff
