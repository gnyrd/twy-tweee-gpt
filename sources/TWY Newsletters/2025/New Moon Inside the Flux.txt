New Moon: Inside the Flux

Dear JP,
The Cars had it right:
“It’s so easy to blow up your problems.
It’s so easy to play up your breakdown.
Life’s the same — it’s all inside of you.”
Today’s Libra New Moon might look like imbalance or indecision — but
really, it’s 3ux.
Movement.
The universe adjusting the dials, asking us to notice what is real.
When you stay present inside that Dux instead of reacting to it,
something shifts. The noise drops. Power returns. Suddenly
the “problem” start to look like posibility.
Non-dual Tantra reminds us: there's no such thing as good Dow or bad
Dow

Dow
— only Spanda, the living pulse of life itself, shaping us with each
contraction and expansion. The shake-up is the opening.
This is where the magic happens.
Inside the wobbly. Inside the not-yet. Inside the Dicker of not knowing.
Try this:
When the next unexpected twist hits,
Pause. Breathe. Don’t reach for cookies or cocktails — look for
possibility.
Ask yourself:
Where could this change grow me?
Where is life asking you to stretch, to life your gaze, to spread your wings
a little wider than before?
What if the “imbalance” is actually Tara herself — starlight in motion —
guiding you home through a deeper alignment?
This moon isn’t about Tnding balance.
It’s about realizing it was never lost.
Only hidden under the habit of worry.
Life’s the same.
It’s all inside of you.
Big love in the Dux,
—Tiff
