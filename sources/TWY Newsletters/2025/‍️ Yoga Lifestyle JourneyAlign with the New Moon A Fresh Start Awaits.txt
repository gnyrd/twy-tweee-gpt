Yoga Lifestyle Journey
Hello friends,
This coming week’s new moon is an invitation to pause, reconnect with
yourself, and plug into the strength of our community. It’s a powerful
time to re?ect and ask:

time to re?ect and ask:
Am I living in alignment with what supports my true rhythm?
This moment encourages us to reassess how we’re using our energy,
how we’re showing up in the world, and how we can nurture ourselves in
ways that feel authentic and sustainable.
By making small, intentional commitments to our well-being, we not only
support our personal growth but amplify the collective power we share
as a community.
The energy of this time magniDes whatever we focus on, so let’s support
one another in choosing hope, inspiration, and alignment. Together, we
have the strength to realign, grow, and create a brighter path forward.

With love and possibility,
Tiff
