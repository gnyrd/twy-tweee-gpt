Dear ones,
This week’s Violet Flame meditation is now yours to revisit anytime you
wish. This is not a one-time offering, but a ritual of return: a way to clear
space again and again, especially when the noise of wanting threatens
to drown out the quiet wisdom of allowing.
Because what you want and what you’re ready to allow are not always

Because what you want and what you’re ready to allow are not always
the same.
Allowing takes honesty. Spaciousness. Trust in the unseen.
And a willingness to become the vessel that can actually receive.
As for me—I’m in a sacred season of listening.
Something opened wide in the space around my mother’s passing. A
clarity. A calling. A sense that my mission is shifting—not away from
what I’ve built, but deeper into what truly sustains.
I’m sifting through what has soul value, and letting go of anything that
doesn’t.
What’s becoming clear is this:
Heart-centered practice. Sacred ritual. Ceremony.
This is what nourishes our Human Family right now.
And just as conscious ritual creates powerful forward
momentum, unconscious ritual can block the Kow of energy toward what
truly serves.
So more than ever, I’m committed to offering practices that maintain the
soul of yoga—and the soul of you.
The Violet Flame meditation is below. Come back to it whenever you
need to clear space, reclaim your clarity, or open to what’s truly ready to
be allowed in.
With devotion and love,
Tiff

Violet Flame Meditation

When life asks us to revisit the tender parts of ourselves we’ve hidden or
outgrown —we can use this meditation to invite radical clarity and inner
recalibration.
This guided meditation calls in the Violet Flame of Transmutation and the
presence of Archangel Zadkiel, who holds the frequencies of forgiveness, mercy,
and alchemical transformation.
You’ll be guided to:
• Visualize violet light in the heart space
• Offer old wounds, confusion, or resentment to the Kame
• Reconnect to a voice of inner truth and grace
• Remember that healing doesn’t mean erasing the wound—it means loving
yourself through it
Ideal for moments of emotional heaviness, energetic clearing, or spiritual
integration.
Sit comfortably, close your eyes, and let this practice sanctify your inner space.
“You are not broken. You are breaking open.”
