Crone Rising: A Love Note to Growth, Grief & Soul Time
This past week, I stepped out of my usual 9ow and into a four-day
workshop called The Magical Realms of the Sacred Self. Not yoga—but
just as transformative. It’s been 22 years since I last took this same
workshop, and this time, I arrived with a different heart—one still healing
from my mom’s passing, but more whole than I realized.
One moment that stayed with me came during the closing circle, where

One moment that stayed with me came during the closing circle, where
we gave verbal acknowledgments to one another. A glowing 20-year-old
called me a Crone. My >rst reaction? Oof. Did she just call me old?
But then I remembered: in sacred traditions, the Crone is the wise one—
whole, radiant, unshakable. She holds the Lre of experience and the
grace of presence. I’m learning to embrace that re9ection, even when it
surprises me.
In Anusara, we speak of Spanda—the pulsation between contraction and
expansion. That moment was both. And like all good practice, it opened
me. Shri, the intrinsic beauty in all things, reminds me that silver hair,
strong bones, and soft hearts are sacred, too.
How others see us is often a re9ection of the light we’ve allowed
ourselves to become.
So with that, I’m taking my Lrst Soul Vacation since my mom passed. I’ll
be traveling with two amazing women in their 70s—silver-haired, strong,
radiant. Because healing, joy, and inspiration are part of the path, too.
Note: No class on Saturday, July 26 at 9 AM.
I’m taking time to listen inward and honor this season of life.
With love and gratitude,
Tiff
