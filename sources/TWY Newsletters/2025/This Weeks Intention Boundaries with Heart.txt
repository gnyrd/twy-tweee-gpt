This Week’s Intention
I honor my limits as acts of love.
My boundaries create space for my heart to breathe.

Dear JP,
In Mondays class, we explored “The Art of the Threshold.”
Just like your front door invites in what nourishes and keeps out what
disturbs your peace, your shoulders are sacred thresholds — the
doorway between your heart and the world.
But sometimes, that doorway gets stuck:
Closed too tight from overprotection... or Cung wide open from
overextension.
I asked:
What if honoring your limits isn’t withdrawal—but deep self-respect?

What if honoring your limits isn’t withdrawal—but deep self-respect?
What if alignment could feel like clarity—not rigidity?
In our movement, we worked with Shoulder Loop and Skull Loop to
soften and reGne this inner threshold.
We learned how support creates safety, and how that safety allows the
heart to open.

Want to Feel This in Your Body?

We’re also continuing to test our updated class format—
You’ll see a yogi demo on-screen
I’ll teach like I do in person—off the mat, fully present
More personal, more precise, more connected

Or just hit reply—I’d love to hear how this theme resonates for you.
With clear shoulders and a steady heart,
Tiff
