Yoga Lifestyle Journey
Dear Kula,

As February closes, it’s time to integrate, release, and realign with where
we’re headed next.

This theme is deeply personal for me right now. Some days, I’m
grounded & productive; other times, I surrender and let my emotions
lead me back to what I hold sacred. The world around us is shifting—
radically. Being a leader, a parent to my parents, and a guide to myself
means holding space for others while still Gercely protecting the space I
need.

That’s what this Gnal week of Harmonic Reverie is about:
holding space for our own renewal.
Feb 24 – “Soft Strength” (Stretch & Strengthen): Build resilience
through stability and release—because surrender isn’t collapsing.
Feb 25 – “Aligned Surrender” (Principles of Anusara): Explore Juidity
within structure, reGning the balance of effort and trust.
Feb 27 – “Move Like Water” (Dynamic Flow): Ride the wave of breath
and motion, moving intuitively and expansively.
Feb 27 - “New Moon, New Habit”: Aligning Bio-Rhythm & Sleep
March 1 – “Dream Into Being” (Expanding Potential): Align vision, heart,
and action, stepping boldly into what’s next.
It’s a week of deep reset for body and mind. Let’s Jow into the next
chapter together.With strength & surrender.
