Dear JP,
Just a reminder that we’ll gather tomorrow, Saturday, June 28 at 9:00-10:45 AM

We’ll move together in a soulful, grounding practice from 9-10:15 AM MT
And if you’d like to stay, the last 30 minutes (10:15-10:45 AM MT) will be an
optional reOection circle

If your body’s still integrating the retreat—or simply craving presence—I’d love to
see you.
With care,
Tiff
