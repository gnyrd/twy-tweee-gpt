Hi JP,
I wanted to let you know that this Saturday’s 9am class (September
27) is canceled while I attend a healing retreat this weekend.
I’m taking this time to rest and re=ll — and I hope you'll do the same in
your own way.
Even though we won’t gather live this week, your practice can still hold
you. Below are two offerings to support you — body, breath, and heart —
if and when you’re called:

A Heartful Practice
Choose a class from the Heartful Series, a collection of 8 recorded
practices that each hold a different Iavor of emotional support — from
courage and joy to stillness and trust.
Acceptance – for stability and breath

Basics on Backbends – for heart and spine support
Big Leap – for boldness and strength
Friendliness – for receiving and offering with ease
Happy Heart – for supported expansion
Feel Good – for softness and prep for Full Wheel
Trust – for heart-deep surrender
Quiet Center – for slowness and peace

New: Meditation with Tiffany
This is a new space I’ve been quietly building, and you’re the =rst to step
inside it. Meditation with Tiffany is a growing collection of guided
meditations to help you center, clear, and reconnect with your inner
teacher.

This is a perfect week to let your practice meet you exactly where you
are.
You might revisit a class you’ve “hearted” in your library — like Hip
Harmony or Happy Tummy — or try something new from the heart.
Thank you for holding this space with me. I’ll see you back on the mat
soon.
With love,
Tiffany
