Yoga Lifestyle Journey
Subject: Come As You Are – Our Kula Conversation is Tomorrow
No need to 5nish (or even read) the book—just bring your heart.
Dear Kula,

Dear Kula,
Just a gentle reminder that our book discussion is tomorrow
night, Tuesday, April 8 at 6 pm.
It doesn’t matter if you’ve 5nished—or even started—The Fifth Sacred
Thing. What matters is that we’re holding space together. A space to
talk, reIect, and stay grounded in what truly matters as so much around
us shifts.
Twenty-three years ago, The Fifth Sacred Thing transformed my
worldview. Now, I see it as more vital than ever—a powerful tool to
deepen our collective identity, spark meaningful conversations, and
expand our capacity to meet this moment with courage and resilience.
This gathering is about more than a book. It’s about our sacred practice
informing the world we want to create. I hope you’ll join us.
With love,
Tiff

Join us at 6 PM MT

Something gentle, grounding, and nourishing is coming….
We’ve been dreaming up a guided seasonal cleanse just for our Kula
members — something that gently resets the body, supports digestion,
and clears the mental fog... without fasting or restriction.
The Kula Cleanse is a 10-day Ayurvedic reset guided by Adele and
supported by me — and it’s happening May 12–21
Think: warming foods, grounding practices, community support, and
a deep sense of clarity.
Save the date:
Our live prep call is happening May 1 at 6:30pm MT – we’ll walk you
through everything and answer questions.
Keep an eye out this week — early sign-up opens Wednesday with a
special bonus for the 5rst few to join!
