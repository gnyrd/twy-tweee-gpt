Dear JP,
After the holiday weekend… you might be feeling full.
Full of food, full of sun, full of people—or maybe just full of feeling.
Let’s land together.
This is your reminder—and your invitation.
Embracing the Light wraps tomorrow with a very special class:
Stretch & Strengthen: Anusara® Yoga
Live Monday, July 7 @ 5:30 PM - 7PM MT
Move with us from 5:30-6:30PM MT and we will close with an optional 30-minute
reFection circle (6:30-7PM MT) to help you carry the wisdom of this series into
whatever’s next.
