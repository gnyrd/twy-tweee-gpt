Dear Seeker…

Sending you love and deepest gratitude for being part of our recent
Master Class at The Shop Yoga Studio!
Last night, I had the privilege of attending a Women’s gathering, where I
was so moved by one person’s re5ection on Kali’s teachings. She shared
how realizing that the Divine Masculine supports and balances her wild,
untamed Divine Feminine was deeply aGrming. What a powerful insight!
I’m curious—what was your personal “aha” moment from our practice
together? I’d truly love to hear about it.

I’d love to know….

Share your Kali Insights

Your presence, both on and off the mat, is a gift that I am endlessly
grateful for. As we continue to grow together, I want to know how best
to serve and support your journey. Your voice and experiences are
important to me.
I can’t wait to connect with you again!

November 23, 2024 - Buddha & Compassionate Hip Opening:
3pm - 5pm
December 14, 2024 - Shiva & Shakti, The Eternal Flame:
