Dear Seeker…
Thank you for bringing your OM!
September 21, 2024, from 3 pm to 5 pm.

Krishna.

I’m excited to share a wonderful story of Krishna as the
Cow Hearder - who calls in the “lovers of life” to share in a
FULL MOON ceremony.
This practice strengthens the body, opens the heart, and cultivates a
light-hearted, yet grounded spirit. Emotionally, you’ll experience a
balance between effort and ease, leaving you feeling empowered and

connected.
Are you ready to honor the Equinox and step into the playful dance of
life?
….bring an open heart, and a willingness
to remember your inner child.

Love,
Tiff
