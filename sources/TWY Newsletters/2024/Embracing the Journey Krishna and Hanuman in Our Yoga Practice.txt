Yoga Lifestyle Journey
Dear Yoga Community,
I hope this message 9nds you well and grounded. I am writing to you
from a space of deep personal re>ection and commitment to the yogic
path of the householder. As many of you know, I am currently caring for
my beloved mother, who is battling both dementia and a severe case of
pneumonia. These circumstances have called me to simplify my
activities and focus my energy on my family responsibilities.

In the spirit of simplicity and presence, I will not be writing out the
"what's ahead" section for this newsletter. Rest assured, all the classes
for next week are happening as planned, and I promise you, they will be
magical and transformative. We are midway through our exploration of
Krishna’s teachings, embodying his playful wisdom and divine guidance.
As we >ow through these lessons, we prepare to transition into the
inspiring stories and energies of Hanuman.
Krishna, with his playful nature and profound wisdom, teaches us the
importance of joy and balance even amidst chaos. Hanuman, with his
unwavering devotion and immense strength, reminds us of the power of
faith and dedication. Together, they hold us in the demands of life,
offering a unique support that only yogis can truly embrace.
Our journey through these teachings allows us to 9nd grace and
strength in our own lives, no matter how challenging the circumstances
may be. As we continue our practice, may we all draw inspiration from
these divine 9gures, 9nding joy in our actions and strength in our
devotion.
Thank you for your understanding and continued support. I look forward
to seeing you on the mat and sharing the beauty of this journey with you
all.
With love and light,
Tiff
