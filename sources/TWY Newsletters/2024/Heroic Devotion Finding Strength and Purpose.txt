Dear Seeker…
We all face moments in life that challenge us to dig deep, 9nd strength,
and practice compassion. These experiences can be profoundly
transformative, reminding us of the power of sel>ess service and
devotion. Over the years, through many personal challenges—like caring
for my mother as she navigates dementia—I’ve found guidance and
inspiration in the story of Hanuman, the playful Monkey God.

In our upcoming series,

“Heroic Devotion: Finding Strength and Purpose,”
we’ll bring Hanuman’s wisdom to life, exploring how yoga can help us
navigate life’s challenges with grace and courage.

navigate life’s challenges with grace and courage.
Through dynamic asanas, captivating stories, and introspective
practices, we’ll learn to embody Hanuman’s playful spirit and powerful
lessons.
Are you to release outdated patterns?
Let’s cultivate inner strength, discover purpose in our actions,
and serve the world with devotion.
Join me in this transformative journey, where together, we’ll let
Hanuman’s teachings inspire us to
make the world a better place, one OM at a time.
with unwavering devotion,
Tiff
