Yoga Lifestyle Journey
In today’s complex world, especially as The
U.S. yogis approach a turbulent election,

U.S. yogis approach a turbulent election,
transitioning from the <erce teachings of Kali to the serene presence of
Buddha offers a valuable pathway.
The teachings of Anusara Yoga, which emphasize alignment with the
Aow of grace, resonate deeply with this shift. Anusara’s <rst principle,
“Open to Grace,”
invites us to see beyond duality and opposition, encouraging an
openness that is especially relevant in times of political tension and
societal stress.
As we shift from the ?ery power of Kali to the compassion of Buddha,
we learn to embody a nonjudgmental presence—essential for both
personal healing and collective well-being.
Be sure to join our practices rooted in grounded compassion, with hip
openers and forward folds, to help cultivate an inner peace that
prepares us to meet challenges with equanimity.
Compassion, in essence, asks us to meet each moment with patience
and understanding—creating stability and peace amidst the chaos. In
the words of the Anusara Invocation, we open our hearts to the divine
within, ?nding peace that “lights the way to transformation”
By moving from Kali’s <erce, protective energy to Buddha’s calm
compassion, we’re invited to be both grounded and open-hearted. This
transition is not about passivity but about standing ?rm in our truth with
the grace of compassion—one of the most
profound acts of courage in uncertain times.

5 - 6 PM MST
A powerful discussion on
Sage Warrior by Valerie Kaur, led by Mary Christa Smith.
This session offers a unique space to explore Kaur’s dual archetype of
the “sage warrior”—one who radiates love and channels it into
courageous action. The book draws from Sikh teachings and ancestral
stories, particularly of often-overlooked women who lived as sages and
warriors to ?ght for justice and unity .
Join us for a 60-minute virtual gathering where
we’ll reAect on
how to cultivate resilience, compassion, and “revolutionary love”
in our own communities.
Even if you haven’t read the book, you’re welcome to listen to Kaur’s
conversation with Brené Brown for context, and join us as we uncover
practical wisdom from these teachings.
