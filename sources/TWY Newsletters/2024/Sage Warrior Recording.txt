Hello My Loves…
A HUGE THANK YOU
to Mary Christa
for hosting a profound and meaningful conversation on Sage Warrior.
It was exquisite.
And thanks to you all for sharing your wisdom and love.
It was truly a sacred place for our community to gather. Let this be an
invitation to engage in this deeply meaningful discussion and connect
with the wisdom that emerged.
To those who joined live, your shared wisdom and love created a sacred
space for our community to gather and grow.
For those who couldn’t make it, I highly encourage you to watch or listen
to the recording. You’ll Qnd immense value in reRecting on and
answering the thoughtful questions Mary Christa posed.

This is a beautiful opportunity to engage deeply and nourish your spirit.
Thank you, Mary Christa, for your incredible leadership and grace.

Tiff
