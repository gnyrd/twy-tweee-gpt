Yoga Lifestyle Journey
In times of loss and emotional turmoil, 6nding lightness and joy can be
challenging. Many of us in our community have recently experienced
profound sorrow from losing loved ones. As Douglas Brooks wisely
says, grief and love are two sides of the same coin. (thanks Edie) When we
take the courage to love deeply, we must accept that the corresponding
grief will be equally profound. While the pain of grief is inevitable, the
teachings and stories of yoga offer profound ways to navigate
challenges and 6nd solace.

The Story of Krishna and Kaliya
Krishna, known for his divine playfulness, encountered the serpent
Kaliya, who had poisoned the Yamuna River. This fearsome serpent
symbolizes the obstacles and fears that paralyze us. Rather than
avoiding the serpent or being overtaken by anger or powerlessness,
Krishna chose to confront it directly. He danced on the serpent’s heads,
subduing Kaliya with grace and joy.
By feeling the power of the obstacle and responding with playful
strength, Krishna teaches us that even in the darkest times, we can ;nd
lightness and overcome our challenges.
Krishna’s Flute: The Call to Harmony
Krishna’s Oute is a symbol of divine harmony and the call to a higher
state of consciousness. The melodious notes invite us to rise above our
sorrows and embrace the beauty of life. Similarly, our yoga practice can
be a conduit for healing, helping us to open our hearts and reconnect
with our innate joy.
Embracing Muscular and Organic Energy
In our practice, we harness the power of Muscular Energy and Organic
Energy to navigate life’s challenges. Muscular Energy represents our
inner strength and resilience, grounding us even when the world feels
unstable. Organic Energy is about expansion and openness, encouraging
us to breathe deeply and embrace life’s Oow.
Balancing these energies creates a harmonious =ow within ourselves,
much like Krishna’s =ute. This balance helps us confront grief and
obstacles with strength and a light heart.
Heart-Opening Asanas for Healing

Heart-opening poses are particularly powerful in times of loss and
emotional depletion. These asanas physically open the chest and heart
area, allowing us to release stored emotions and invite in healing and
joy.
1. Bhujangasana (Cobra Pose): Encourages deep breathing and

releases tension in the heart center.
2. Ustrasana (Camel Pose): Stretches the front of the body, helping us
confront and release deep-seated emotions.
3. Urdhva Dhanurasana (Wheel Pose): Requires strength and
openness, symbolizing our ability to rise above challenges with joy.
4. Anahatasana (Melting Heart Pose): Opens the heart while
grounding the body, offering a deep sense of surrender and release.
5. Savasana (Corpse Pose): A pose of deep relaxation and surrender,
allowing us to integrate our practice and 6nd peace.
Finding Joy through Playfulness
Krishna’s playful dance on Kaliya reminds us that joy and playfulness are
vital aspects of overcoming life’s challenges.
It’s important to acknowledge that ;nding a joyful attitude isn’t a form
of spiritual bypass; it doesn’t mean ignoring our pain or pretending
everything is ;ne.
Instead, it’s about allowing the practices of yoga to be a doorway to the
heart. Often, it’s not easy to overcome the obstacle of feeling like you’re
drowning, but through yoga, we can create space for lightness and joy to
enter, helping us transform fear and sorrow into opportunities for growth
and liberation.
A Community of Support
Our yoga community is a sanctuary where we support each other in our

healing journeys. By practicing together, sharing stories, and holding
space for one another, we create a collective energy that ampli6es our
healing. Let’s honor our loved ones and our shared grief by embracing
the teachings of Krishna and the power of heart-opening yoga.
As we navigate through life’s obstacles, let’s remember Krishna’s =ute
and his playful dance. Let our practice be a dance of strength and joy,
helping us open our hearts and embrace the lightness of being.

With love and playful joy,
Tiff
