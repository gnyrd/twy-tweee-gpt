Dear Seeker…
Why Yogis Make Offerings: A Tale of Devotion and
Divine Mischief
Let me tell you about the time my friend’s son got sent home for saying,
“I believe in the power of the Monkey God!” during class.
You’d think he dropped a Drecracker in a meditation session, the way his
teacher reacted. But for those of us who know Hanuman, the beloved
Monkey God, it’s not just a belief—it’s a way of life.

Monkey God, it’s not just a belief—it’s a way of life.
So, what’s so special about Hanuman that even an 8-year-old is inspired
to proclaim his devotion?
The Mischief and Might of Hanuman
Hanuman isn’t your average deity. He’s the embodiment of strength,
devotion, and, yes, a bit of mischief—like that kid who Mips into a
handstand while others make peace with downward dog.
In the Ramayana, Hanuman plays a crucial role in rescuing Sita from the
demon king Ravana. And he does it all with Mair—Mying, lifting
mountains, and charming everyone with his monkey face. This isn’t a
god who sits quietly on a lotus Mower; he’s out there making things
happen.
Why We Make Offerings
We offer fruits and sweets to Hanuman not just because he’s got a
sweet tooth (though he does). We do it to honor his unwavering
devotion, strength, and his ability to overcome obstacles with a playful,
yet
deeply committed spirit.
Consider this: Hanuman once leaped across the ocean to reach Lanka,
fueled by his unwavering devotion to Lord Rama. Such profound
dedication is more than deserving of the humble offering of bananas.
Back to the School Incident
So, when the teacher asked who the kids looked to in times of diXculty,
this little yogi conDdently declared, “I believe in the power of the Monkey
God!”
Cue the confusion.
The teacher, clearly not up to speed on Hindu mythology, sent him home

The teacher, clearly not up to speed on Hindu mythology, sent him home
with a note. My friend was more amused than anything—her son was
just channeling his inner Hanuman, unafraid to stand up for what he
believes in, even if it confused the adults.
The Takeaway
Hanuman shows us that devotion doesn’t have to be rigid. It can be
joyful, transformative, and Mexible, meeting us wherever we are. This
god who once mistook the sun for a mango teaches us to blend serious
devotion with playful spirit.
So, the next time you see a bunch of bananas on the altar, remember: it’s
not just an offering; it’s a nod to the power of devotion, the spirit of
strength, and the undeniable charm of the Monkey God. And who
knows? Maybe you’ll feel inspired to leap across your own ocean and
stand up for what you believe in.
Keep smiling and hero-ing,
Tiff
