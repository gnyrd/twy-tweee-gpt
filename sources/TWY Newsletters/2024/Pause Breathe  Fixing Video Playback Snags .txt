Yoga Lifestyle Journey
Thanks to all of you who have told us about the video play back issues.
I’m sorry this is interrupting your ability to have a smooth, peaceful, and
consistent practice!
t’s not something speci?c to you or your devices. It actually appears to
affect the entire website, not just video playback. We’ve escalated the
problem to our hosting platform provider and hope to have a response
from them soon.

Our apologies for any issues you may be experiencing! I wish I had
either a solution or some workaround today. We’ll will continue to look
for a quick resolution!
At this point, we are waiting for a response from the provider (Hey
Marvelous).
I hope you know how important you and your practice is to me and all of
us here on your Yoga Lifestyle team. Perhaps this is due to the epic
solar eclipse happening tomorrow and it will magically ?x itself once the
Universe is done with the radical magic show.
I will share more as soon as there is more to share.
Humbly,
Tiff
