Dear Seeker…
Embracing the Flow of Change: On and Off the Mat
As we navigate the week ahead, it’s a potent reminder that we are
connected to a larger energy—one that touches us personally and
collectively. Often, just like in life, there are moments when we
experience internal >are-ups, discomforts, or wounds rising to the

experience internal >are-ups, discomforts, or wounds rising to the
surface. In yoga, we call this pulsation or movement of energy spanda—
the constant ebb and Aow of life force that we feel both within and
around us.
When we practice yoga, we become aware of this subtle pulsation,
learning to recognize how it affects our body, breath, and mind. Spanda
teaches us that life is not static but dynamic, constantly shifting
between contraction and expansion. Just as our breath moves in and
out, so do the experiences that challenge and heal us.
This week, ask yourself: How can you become the healer for yourself?
How can you take those moments of discomfort and use them to grow,
to create balance, and to offer yourself compassion? Whether on the
mat or off, this process of healing happens as we learn to hold space for
both the challenges and the ease, the dark and the light.
By recognizing the >uctuations within, we align with a greater rhythm of
life—one that reminds us we are all interconnected, experiencing these
shifts together in different ways. Our collective healing is just as
important as our personal journey. Yoga offers us the tools to move with
these energies gracefully, to Lnd stillness in the movement and
movement within stillness.
Trust the process, embrace the pulsation of life, and carry the wisdom
from your practice into everything you do.

Tips & Highlights

“As we move into arm balances like Bakasana, we shift energy from the
hips to the heart—drawing inward, then expanding outward. It’s about
embracing the process and trusting your inner strength, not perfection.”

Elizabeth T. shares her experience:
“This month’s series has really allowed me to face my fears, especially
around speaking my truth. I’ve been working through throat chakra
tension, learning to set boundaries, and giving myself permission to say
‘no’ without feeling like I have to take care of everyone. The Sovereignty
class brought it all together for me.”
