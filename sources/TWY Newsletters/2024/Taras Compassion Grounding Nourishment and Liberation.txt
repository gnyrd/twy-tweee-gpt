Dear Seeker…
Are you honoring the shift of the season, or are you feeling swept away
by the winds of change?
As fall approaches, bringing with it new schedules, it’s easy to be caught
up in the whirlwind. But this is a time to ground yourself, to slow down
and move with intention. Compassion—for yourself and others—
becomes essential. It allows you to embrace the transition mindfully,
navigating the shifts with grace and Anding balance as we step into the
season of reBection and renewal.
How can we navigate through the changing tides with a heart full of
understanding and care?

We need our nurturing, protective energy to stay grounded and centered,
offering us the strength to move through this season with ease and
purpose. As we honor this shift, let compassion be your anchor, guiding
you with kindness and helping you embrace the transitions with grace.
with a steady heart and grounded feet,
Tiff
