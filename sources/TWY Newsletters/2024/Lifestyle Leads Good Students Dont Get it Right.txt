Dear Seeker…
Embracing the Critic and Becoming Life’s Best Student
This week, the inner critic might be particularly loud, echoing doubts like,
“No, that didn’t work. No, you’re wrong. No, you didn’t do enough.”
Whether this critic is internal or external, its presence is strong. But how
do we navigate through this dense fog of negativity?
Adhikara: Being a Student of Life

Adhikara: Being a Student of Life
In yoga, Adhikara refers to being a competent student. This concept
encourages us to embrace our role as lifelong learners, especially when
the critic is loudest. Instead of seeing mistakes as failures, we can view
them as crucial lessons for growth.
Adhikara teaches us that being a good student isn’t about getting
everything right; it’s about being curious, asking questions, and
accepting mistakes as part of the learning process. These mistakes are
essential—they’re the wisdom we need to digest and integrate.
Tara, the deity of our September series, embodies wisdom and
compassion. She reminds us to meet our inner critic with the same care
she offers, transforming criticism into opportunities for growth.
Mistakes as Pathways to Mastery
True conJdence isn’t about avoiding mistakes but learning from them.
Mastery is developed through trial and error, by being in tricky moments
and saying, “I did that incorrectly, but now I know better. Let’s adjust and
move forward.”
This week, let’s move beyond binary thinking—right vs. wrong—and
focus on what we’re learning. Life is the teacher, and we are our own
best students. We’re not striving for perfection; we’re striving to be the
best learners by integrating lessons, asking questions, and embracing
confusion.
Moving Forward with Compassion
As we navigate this week, let’s invoke Tara’s energy to soften our
approach. Where could we be more direct? What are we afraid to lose if

approach. Where could we be more direct? What are we afraid to lose if
we’re honest? This is a time to sit with these questions and recognize
that we’re all learning.
Let’s embrace this journey with the heart of a student, guided by Tara’s
wisdom, knowing that every mistake is a stepping stone to greater
growth and compassion.
May your Inner Critic take a well deserved Savasana,
Tiff
