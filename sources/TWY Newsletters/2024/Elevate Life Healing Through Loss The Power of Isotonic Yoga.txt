The Science Behind Isotonic Exercise in Yoga
Isotonic exercises are characterized by movement against a constant
load, which leads to the contraction and extension of muscles. In yoga,
this is seen in the Cow of poses such as Vinyasa, Sun Salutations, and
dynamic sequences that require both strength and Cexibility. Here’s how
isotonic yoga works on a scienti;c level:

poses, yoga increases muscle ;ber recruitment and hypertrophy.
This builds muscle strength and endurance over time.

Flexibility Enhancement: The dynamic stretching involved in
isotonic yoga improves the elasticity of muscles and tendons,
leading to increased Cexibility.
3. Improved Circulation: Moving through poses promotes better blood

Yoga and Navigating Loss
Loss, whether it’s the death of a loved one, the end of a relationship, or a
signi;cant life change, brings about intense emotional and physical
stress. Engaging in isotonic yoga can be a therapeutic way to navigate
this diQcult time. Here’s how:

Physical Release: The movements in yoga help release physical

grief. By engaging in isotonic exercises, you can physically work
through some of the stress and tension that loss creates.

balance the nervous system, reducing symptoms of anxiety and
depression. The meditative aspect of yoga provides a safe space to

mind and body, promoting mindfulness. This awareness can be
particularly grounding when navigating the turbulent emotions
associated with loss.
4. Community Support: Joining a yoga class can provide a sense of
community and support, which is invaluable during times of loss.
Sharing space with others who may also be seeking healing can
create a supportive environment.

Wellness Wisdom
Accessible and
Relatable
Some yogis use creative English
names for the postures, which
can be more accessible and
relatable for some practitioners.
I’m a traditional yogi; the
Sanskrit names are just easier
and more meaningful for me, as
they carry a rich history and
deeper signi;cance.
