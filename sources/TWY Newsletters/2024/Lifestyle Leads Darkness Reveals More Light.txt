Dear Seeker…
Full Moon Eclipse Meets Fall Equinox: A Tantric Path to
Grounding Your Spiritual Vision
The cosmic forces of a Full Moon Eclipse aligned with the Fall Equinox
offer us a potent opportunity to align with the dance of Anugraha
(revelation) and Nigraha (concealment). In non-dual Tantra, these forces

work together to unveil our deepest truths while still holding space for
what’s not yet ready to emerge. During this time, the balance between
light and shadow invites us to bring our spiritual visions into grounded
reality.
As beings in what we might call “Earth School,” it’s essential to align
ourselves with the rhythms of the cosmos. These celestial cycles are
mirrors of our own internal processes, reminding us that spiritual growth
happens through both revelation and patient concealment. By aligning
with these larger energies, we attune ourselves to the Mow of the
universe, making our journey through life more harmonious and
conscious.

The Dance of Anugraha and Nigraha
The Full Moon Eclipse reMects the play of Anugraha, the grace that
reveals, and Nigraha, the power that conceals. This cosmic event invites
you to reMect on your visions: What is being revealed to you, and what
remains hidden, waiting for the right time to emerge?
The Fall Equinox, a time when day and night are in balance, mirrors this
duality. It’s a reminder that in order to grow, we must honor both the
clarity that comes with revelation and the mystery of concealment. The
energy of the moon allows us to dream, while the grounding force of the
equinox reminds us to take practical steps to root those dreams into
reality.

Off the Mat: Aligning with Cosmic Wisdom
In life, we are always navigating between what is seen and what is still
unfolding. As part of Earth School, it’s essential to recognize that both
revelation and concealment are necessary for our growth.

revelation and concealment are necessary for our growth.

Journaling Prompts: create space for both the light of
awareness and the sacredness of what remains hidden.
• Anugraha (Revelation): What truths or insights are beginning to reveal
themselves to me at this time? How can I open myself to the grace of
these revelations?
• Nigraha (Concealment): What aspects of my life or dreams are still
being concealed? How can I trust in the timing of their unfolding?

On the Mat: Embodying the Cosmic Dance
On the mat, we can embody the dance of Anugraha and Nigraha through
movement and breath. In Anusara Yoga, we always begin by Opening to
Grace—a direct connection to Anugraha, the Mow of divine energy.
Equally important is Nigraha, the containment that allows us to channel
that energy inward, grounding our visions into reality.

Pose: Virabhadrasana III (Warrior III Pose)
This pose represents the balance of expansion and grounding. As you
extend forward, reach for your dreams (Anugraha), while your standing
leg roots you into the earth (Nigraha), holding space for what is yet to
manifest. In this pose, feel both grace and strength working together to
bring balance.

Pranayama: Nadi Shodhana for Inner Balance
(Alternate Nostril Breathing) This pranayama harmonizes the lunar and
solar energies, helping you remain centered as you navigate the dynamic
forces of revelation and concealment.

1. Inhale through the left nostril, close it, and exhale through the right.
2. Inhale through the right, close it, and exhale through the left.
3. Continue for several minutes, feeling the balance between the inner
and outer worlds.

Conclusion: Living in Alignment with the Cosmos
As spiritual beings in Earth School, we are here to learn how to balance
the cosmic and the earthly. The Full Moon Eclipse invites us to see the
parts of ourselves that are ready for the light, while the Fall Equinox
reminds us of the importance of grounding that insight in reality. By
embracing both Anugraha and Nigraha, we align ourselves with the
greater cosmic Mow, deepening our journey of growth.
ReMect, breathe, and move in harmony with the universe. Let the grace
of revelation guide you. Trust the sacred concealment that holds your
potential.
In the Dance of Shadow and Light,

How to Highlights

Sciatica sucks! Well, any nerve pain is unpleasant at best.
My suggestion...try not to go into deep stretch. Find the end point just
before deep stretch and breathe there.
Your body and butt will thank you!
