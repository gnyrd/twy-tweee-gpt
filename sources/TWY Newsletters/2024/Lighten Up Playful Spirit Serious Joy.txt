Dear Seeker…
Imagine a journey where playfulness and self-discovery go hand in hand.
In yoga, we explore our potential not just through poses, but by
remembering our inner child and allowing that wise, playful self to guide
us forward.
Life-a?rming practices like yoga invite us to tap into a sense of
creativity and light-heartedness. When we let our inner child bring
mischief and delight into our lives, we open up life's roadblocks with the
kind of vision only a Cve-year-old wizard could orchestrate. Nurturing our
playful spirit helps us see the world with fresh eyes and an open heart.
Yoga reminds us that the journey is just as important as the destination.

Yoga reminds us that the journey is just as important as the destination.
When we approach life with curiosity and joy, we uncover magic in the
mundane and Cnd extraordinary moments hiding in plain sight.
For me, it’s not about perfect poses, but about enjoying the magic of
remembering my delight.
Let's celebrate the dance of life together.
Stay curious, and let the journey unfold,
Tiff

How does being

~ Playful ~

integrate with living a yogic lifestyle?
Krishna is about living in
ADBHUTA…
Adbhuta represents the
sentiment of wonder,
amazement, or astonishment. It
is the feeling experienced when
encountering something
extraordinary, marvelous, or
surprising. Deepen your

surprising. Deepen your
connection to the heart of your
INNER CHILD, embodying
Krishna’s playful
and loving essence both on and
oﬀ the mat.
Engage with Krishna’s stories to
uncover his timeless teachings
and discover practical
applications for daily life.
Experience increased physical
strength and flexibility, and
cultivate a joyful, playful spirit.
The practice of yoga is far too
important to be taken seriously
because it thrives on the balance
of effort and play, allowing us to
explore our limits with joy and
curiosity. Even challenging
poses like handstands or full
wheel can become expressions
of playful exploration rather than
rigid achievement, fostering a
light-hearted and liberating
approach to growth.
