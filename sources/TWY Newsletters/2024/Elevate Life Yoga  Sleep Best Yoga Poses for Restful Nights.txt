Dear Seeker…
Welcome to Yogic Lifestyle Leads—

The Benefits of Yoga for Improving Sleep: A Summer
Routine Inspired by Krishna
Summer brings vibrant energy and busy days. Amidst the fun,
maintaining a healthy sleep routine is crucial. We can use yoga to
ensure restful nights and rejuvenated days.
The Importance of Regulating Sleep

The Importance of Regulating Sleep
In the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna stresses the need for
balance in all aspects of life, including sleep.
He tells Arjuna, "One cannot become a yogi... if one eats too much or too
little, sleeps too much or too little."
During summer, our busy schedules can disrupt sleep patterns, affecting
mood, energy, and health. Keeping a regular sleep routine helps maintain
the balance Krishna advocates.
Restful Nights: Yoga Poses to Improve Sleep Quality and Why
They Work
1. Reduces Stress and Anxiety

Deep breathing and mindfulness in yoga reduce stress and anxiety.
Poses like Child's Pose (Balasana) and Corpse Pose (Savasana)
calm the mind and promote relaxation.
2. Balances the Nervous System
Yoga activates the parasympathetic nervous system, encouraging
relaxation. Poses such as Forward Bend (Uttanasana) and Legs-Upthe-Wall (Viparita Karani) soothe the nervous system.
3. Improves Breathing
Yoga promotes deep, rhythmic breathing, enhancing oxygen Vow
and calming the mind. Techniques like Pranayama (breath practice)
are especially relaxing. Try Nadi Shodhana (alternate nostril
breathing) before bed.
4. Relieves Physical Tension
Summer activities can cause physical tension. Gentle yoga
stretches like Cat-Cow Pose (Marjaryasana-Bitilasana) and
Reclining Bound Angle Pose (Supta Baddha Konasana) release
tension and promote relaxation.
5. Encourages Mindfulness

Yoga includes mindfulness and meditation to quiet the mind.
Krishna’s teachings on focusing on the present moment help

Krishna’s teachings on focusing on the present moment help
achieve mental clarity for restful sleep.
Creating a Summer Sleep Routine with Yoga
1. Consistent Schedule: Regulate your internal clock with a consistent

wake time. Honor “your tired” and go to bed earlier.
2. Evening Yoga: 15 minutes each evening focus on calming poses

and breathing exercises.
3. Mindfulness Practice: 5 minutes meditating before bed. ReVect on

Krishna’s teachings of balance and harmony.
4. Relaxing Environment: Dim or turn off the lights - allowing the
natural waning light to guide you into a soft space.
Embracing Krishna’s Wisdom
By integrating yoga into your evening summer routine and embracing
Krishna’s teachings on balance, you can improve sleep and overall wellbeing. As you navigate the busy summer months, prioritize your sleep
routine, drawing inspiration from Krishna’s wisdom to
maintain harmony in your life.
Namaste and Sweet Dreams,
