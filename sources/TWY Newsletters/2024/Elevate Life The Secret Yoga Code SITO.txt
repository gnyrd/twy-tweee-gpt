Dear Seeker…
Welcome to Yogic Lifestyle Leads—
This week's focus on a crucial aspect of yoga practice that can
signi>cantly impact your long-term joint health
—proper knee alignment.
By understanding and implementing the alignment cues "shins in, thighs
out," followed by engaging the buttocks, we can protect our knees and
enhance our overall practice. Let's break down how these actions

enhance our overall practice. Let's break down how these actions
contribute to knee stability and how you can apply them in key poses.
Why Knee Alignment is Crucial
Knees are prone to stress if not properly aligned. Healthy knee
alignment through speci>c cues helps:
Prevent Injuries: Proper alignment distributes forces evenly across
the knee joint, minimizing strain and preventing potential injuries.
Enhance Pose Effectiveness: When knees are correctly aligned, the
intended muscles work more eNciently, deepening the pose's
effectiveness and the strength-building bene>ts.
Support Long-Term Joint Health: Consistent attention to knee
alignment can prevent degenerative changes and support your
yoga practice for years to come.
Implementing 'Shins In, Thighs Out' (SITO) in Your Practice
1. Mountain Pose (Tadasana): Stand with feet hip-width apart for

stability. Drawing your shins inward, press your thighs outward to
align your femur bones with your lower legs, improving knee
stability. Maintain SITO and gently engage your lower buttocks to
ensure your knees track toward the 2nd toes.
2. Warrior II (Virabhadrasana II):
Front/Bent Leg: Focus on pulling the outer shin inward and align
the bent knee with the ankle. Engage your buttocks to gently press
the knee toward the third and fourth toes for proper alignment.
Back/Straight Leg: Follow the Mountain Pose alignment.
3. Chair Pose (Utkatasana): As you bend your knees, concentrate on
drawing your shins towards each other while broadening your
thighs outward - even as you pull the navel to the low back and
draw the buttocks downward toward your heels.
Practice with Precision

Practice with Precision
Each session on your mat is an opportunity to re>ne your practice and
protect your body. Paying attention to the sequence of alignment—shins
in, thighs out, then buttocks engaged—can transform your approach to
each pose, leading to a safer, more powerful practice.
Stay Aligned and Inspired!
With humble love,
Tiff
