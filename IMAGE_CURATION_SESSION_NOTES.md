## Key Observations

### Visual Style Evolution
**Traditional Hindu Iconography (2024 newsletters):**
- Detailed deity depictions (Saraswati, Krishna, Hanuman, Buddha, Kali, Durga)
- Classical devotional art style
- Rich colors, ornate details, traditional symbolism
- Specific goddess/deity identification clear

**Contemporary Spiritual Aesthetics (2025 newsletters):**
- Abstract/silhouette-based compositions
- Geometric mandalas and sacred geometry
- Watercolor, minimalist, double-exposure techniques
- Universal spiritual symbols (chakras, meditation, light)
- Less culturally specific, more accessible
- Emphasis on inner experience vs. external deity

### Quality Assessment
- **All 16 images reviewed: EXCELLENT quality**
- Strong thematic alignment with Tiff's teaching (goddesses, philosophy, practice)
- Range of emotional registers (fierce, peaceful, devotional, contemplative)
- All are strong hero image candidates
